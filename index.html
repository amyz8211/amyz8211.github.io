	<hr>
	<p> This morning I woke up late, had slept through my alarm clock
		<br/> and realized that I had to go to this y-hack thing. I rushed
		<br/> through my morning routine and got into the car. And then I got
		<br/> to Code Blue and I realized I had forgotten my papers, I look to 
		<br/> my left and watch my father drive away.
